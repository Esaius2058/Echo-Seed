# 🌱 EchoSeed

**EchoSeed** is a smart playlist generator built in Python that blends **machine learning**, **Spotify data**, and **AI-powered mood tagging** to create playlists that truly fit your vibe.  

It can:
- Cluster songs by audio features like tempo, energy, and danceability.
- Assign moods to clusters using GPT (with offline fallbacks).
- Let you pick a mood and generate a personalized playlist.
- Randomize or refresh your Spotify playlists with one command.
- Securely handle authentication and keep running even with network hiccups.

---

## Features
- **AI-driven recommendations**: Uses artists from your existing playlists as context, then generates fresh mood-matched track suggestions with Gemini.
- **Spotify integration**: Creates, updates, and randomizes your playlists directly in Spotify.
- **AI-powered naming**: Playlists are given creative names generated by Gemini.
- **Secure tokens**: Handles Spotify OAuth, with refresh tokens stored securely.
- **Network monitor**: Detects when connection is restored and refreshes tokens automatically.
- **CLI interface**: Simple terminal menu for mood-based playlist generation.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/echoseed.git
cd echoseed
```

### 2. Set up environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
create a .env file in the project root:
```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
SECRET_KEY=your_encryption_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

### 4. Authenticate with Spotify
On first run, you’ll be prompted to log into Spotify. After that, your refresh token will be cached securely.

### 5. Run CLI
```bash
python -m main
```
